## Schema Introspection

The connctd GraphQL endpoint exists behind an authentication layer which can make
obtaining the schema for testing or exploring the API slightly cumbersome. For that reason
we have created some helpers for authenticating against the API purely for exploring the schema
or automatically generating type safe GraphQL code for your language of choice.

The GraphQL endpoint has full support for schema introspection so you can choose to generate
your own types with your own API keys should you wish to do so.

### Obtain a key for exploring the schema

You can obtain a key with 30minutes of validity from `https://docs.connctd.io/api/querykey`

> **Request**<br/>
> GET https://docs.connctd.io/api/querykey


Or for convinience you can grab a valid generated key right here:

<div class="generatedKeys">
	<KeyUtilities />
</div>
