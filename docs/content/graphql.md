title: GraphQL API
order: 9
---

We are offering a Graph QL which makes it easier to perform tasks like creating/searching/resolving things.
See our [Tutorial](https://tutorial.connctd.io/tutorials/5/pages/1) in case you need a proper introduction in using our GraphQL API.
We highly recommend using a GraphQL Editor (e.g. integrated in Postman) when playing around with our API.

<aside class="notice">
  When doing requests against our things endpoint you have to pass two headers for a successful request handling:
    <ul>
      <li>Authorization:Bearer -your token-</li>
      <li>X-External-Subject-Id:-any id (e.g. customer id) generated by your app-</li>
    </ul>
</aside>


## Querying

All queries have to be sent against the following endpoint:

> **Request**<br>
> POST https://api.connctd.io/api/v1/query<br>
> *Headers:*<br>
> &nbsp;Content-Type:application/json<br>
> &nbsp;Authorization:YOUR TOKEN<br>
> &nbsp;X-External-Subject-Id:SUBJECT_ID<br>
> *Body:* {"query":"a valid gql query see examples below"}<br>

<aside class="notice">
  Please note: the following queries are structured to improve readability. You can use these queries as show in case you are using a proper gql editor (e.g. integrated in postman). If you send it as a rough json object it needs to be condensed into one single line and put into the "envelope" object like shown above.

### Example 1: Query things and components
```graphql
query {
	things {
		name,
		components {
			id,
			name
		}
	}
}
```

same as

```json
{"query":"query {things {name,components{id,name}}}"}
```

### Example 2: Query things with certain properties
```graphql
query{
	things(thingConstraint: {name: "ExampleOven"}, thingComponentConstraint: {name: "Door"}){
		name
	}
}
```

same as

```json
{"query":"query{things(thingConstraint: {name:\"ExampleOven\"}, thingComponentConstraint: {name: \"Door\"}){name}}"}
```

### Example 3: Query units
```graphql
query {
	units {
		name
	}
}
```

### Example 4: Query units with certain properties
```graphql
query{
	units(unitConstraint: {name:"ExampleKitchen", type:"room"}) {
		name
	}
}
```

### Example 5: Query historic thing values with criteria
```graphql
query {
    things(thingConstraint: {id: "1e999269-a90c-41a3-b388-0eef1d810317"}) {
        id
        name
        components {
            name
            properties {
                name
                history(from: "2020-04-01T22:00:00Z", to: "2020-04-30T22:00:00Z", first: 5, after: "eyJ0aW1lIjoiMjAyMC0wNC0xM1QxNToyOTo1MC44OTA0MTVaIn0=") {
                    totalCount
                    pageInfo {
                        hasNextPage
                        endCursor
                    }
                    edges {
                        node {
                            timestamp
                            value
                        }
                        cursor
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Mutation

All queries have to be sent against the following endpoint:

> **Request**<br>
> POST https://api.connctd.io/api/v1/query<br>
> *Headers:*<br>
> &nbsp;Content-Type:application/json<br>
> &nbsp;Authorization:YOUR TOKEN<br>
> &nbsp;X-External-Subject-Id:SUBJECT_ID<br>
> *Body:* see examples below<br>

### Example 1: Create thing and return its id
```graphql
mutation{
	createThing(thing: {
			name: "My Example Thing",
			manufacturer: "connctd",
			displayType: "core.SIREN",
			mainComponentId: "siren",
			status: AVAILABLE,
			components: [{
				id: "siren",
				name: "Siren",
				componentType: "core.SIREN",
				capabilities: ["core.SWITCH"],
				properties: [{
					id: "on",
					name: "on",
					value: "false",
					unit: "",
					type: BOOLEAN,
					propertyType: "core.ONOFF"
				}],
				actions: [{
					id: "setOn", name: "setOn", parameters: [{
						name: "on",
						type: BOOLEAN
					}]
				}]
			}]
		}
	) {
		id
	}
}
```

### Example 2: Create a unit and return its id
```graphql
mutation{
	createUnit(unit: {name: "ExampleUnit", type: "GROUP"}) {
		id
	}
}
```
