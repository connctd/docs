## What is connctd?

The connctd platform is a scalable and robust platform for the Internet of Things. Our main goal is to provide useful and domain angostic
semantics to enable a new kind of interoperability and empower cross domain use cases. By providing a powerful domain agnostic semantic abstraction
developers aren't forced to handle every detail of IoT hardware anymore and can focus on the meaning and context of gathered data.
Developers connect with devices and services through a unified secure **REST** based interface **or** alternatively via our **GraphQL** api leveraging well known and tested technologies from the web.

## How to get started

The docs will get you started with how to create, manage and update Things and other resources in the world of IoT. If you are unfamiliar with our concepts and how we might help you with your IoT project you can try out our [tutorial](https://tutorial.connctd.io).
